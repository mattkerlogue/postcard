I am a senior analyst and data scientist at the [Cabinet Office](https://www.gov.uk/cabinet-office), my work is largely concentrated on helping other analysts make better use of new tools and techniques. I also occasionally write posts to my personal blog about coding, largely in [R](http://r-project.org).
